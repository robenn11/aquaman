# Wasserpegel
This project is a Telegram bot designed to provide real-time water level updates for the Rhine River at Bonn. By leveraging data from the official [Pegel Online API](https://www.pegelonline.wsv.de/webservice/guideRestapi), the bot offers insights into current water levels and historical trends. It is packaged in a lightweight Docker container for ease of deployment and is intended to include CI/CD pipelines for streamlined updates and task automation.  

This projekt is using GitHub Actions to build and publish a public accessible Docker image after every push or tag to this repository.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system  
- Telegram account  
- Docker  

## Getting started

### Create a Telegram Bot Using BotFather

1. Open Telegram and search for BotFather.
2. Start a chat with BotFather and use the command `/newbot`.
3. Follow the prompts to
   - Give your bot a name
   - Assign it a unique username ending in bot  
4. Once created,you will receive a token that looks like this: `123456789:ABCdefGhIJklMnoPQRstUVwXyZ123456789`

**Important**: Keep this token secure, it grants controle over your bot.

### Set the token as an Environment Variable

For the bot to work locally or in a Docker container, you need to configure the token as an environment variable named `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`.  
  
1. Local Development: Enter the following line to your teminal:
   - `export TELEGRAM_TOKEN="your-bot-token"` for Linux
   - `set TELEGRAM_TOKEN="your-bot-token"` for Windows  
Replace `your-bot-token` with the token provided by BotFather.  

2. Running in Docker: When running the bot in a Docker container, pass the token as an environment variable:
   - `docker run -e TELEGRAM_TOKEN="your-bot-token" ghcr.io/olialtf4/wasserpegel-rhein-bonn`

### Verify the Setup
After setting up, start the bot:
- locally via terminal `python app.py`
- in a docker container `docker run -e TELEGRAM_TOKEN="your-bot-token" ghcr.io/olialtf4/wasserpegel-rhein-bonn:1.0.0`  

You can now interact with your Bot by sending commands like `/start`, `/current` or `/weekly` in Telegram.

## Docker

### 1. Run the Container
To start the bot, use the following command. Replace `INSERT-TOKEN-HERE` with your actual Telegram bot Token:  
- `docker run --name aqua -e TELEGRAM_TOKEN="INSERT-TOKEN-HERE" ghcr.io/olialtf4/wasserpegel-rhein-bonn`  

### 2. Run the Container in the Background
To run the container in detached mode (in the background), add the `-d` flag:  
- `docker run -d --name aqua -e TELEGRAM_TOKEN="INSERT-TOKEN-HERE" ghcr.io/olialtf4/wasserpegel-rhein-bonn`

### 3. Build the Docker Image
If you are building the image locally from a Dockerfile, use:  
- `docker build -t your-image-name .`  
  
Replace `your-image-name` with a name for your image.

### 4. List Docker Images
To view all locally available Docker images, run:  
- `docker images`

### 5. Remove a Docker Image 
To delete a specific Docker image by its ID or name, use:  
- `docker rmi image-id-or-name`  
  
Replace `image-id-or-name` with the images ID or name shown in the output of the `docker images`.
